## Overview

[Konstanz Information Miner, KNIME](https://www.knime.com/) is a free and open-source data analytics and reporting platform that allows users to build and deploy data workflows using a visual, drag-and-drop interface. It is designed for both non-technical users and experienced data scientists, enabling them to access, blend, analyze, and visualize data without needing to write code. KNIME supports a wide range of data science and analytics tasks, from basic automation to advanced geospatial data analytics.

The [**G**]{.underline}**eospatial [A]{.underline}nalytics [E]{.underline}xtension for [K]{.underline}NIME (GAEK)** is a visual programming tool that integrates geospatial analysis with KNIME Analytics Platform. It allows users to perform spatial data analysis and visualization without coding, using nodes for common geospatial tasks and data types. It was developed through a collaboration between the Center for Geographic Analysis at Harvard University and KNIME.Geospatial Analytics Extension of KNIME (GAEK)

This chapter aims to provide users of this workbook step-by-step guides on:

-   installing KNIME Analytics Platform (AP),

### Creating the workspace

Working with KNIME, it is always a good practice to create a workspace. In KNIME, a workspace is a folder on your computer where KNIME Analytics Platform stores your workflows, node configurations, and data. It acts as the central location for all your projects, allowing you to organize, save, and retrieve your work. Essentially, it's the directory where KNIME keeps everything related to your data analysis and workflows.

-   Create a new workspace in the local harddisk as should below.

### Increasing the RAM

For better performance, users can revise the maximum RAM usage limitation in the file knime.ini under the installation folder.

-   Navigate to KNIME programme folder, for example \\Users\\tskam\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\KNIME\\.
-   Open the **knime.ini** by using a text editor such as NotePad for Windows OS users
-   Scolldown the page until the line `-Xmx1024m` appears, change to `-Xmx64g` to increase the RAM limitation for KNIME AP from 1024 Megabytes (Mb) to 64 Gigabytes (Gb).

::: callout-note
You should change the setting according to the RAM available on your computer. On the guide above 64 is used because my laptop installed with 64Gb RAM.
